We experimentally show through which channels the sustainable character of an invest-
ment impacts asset prices. We use experimental asset markets (N=351) with the structure
introduced by Smith, Suchanek, and Williams (1988) to investigate the impact of pos-
itive, neutral, and negative sustainability attributes on trading decisions. Our design
allows us to document a new channel that links real-time investor behavior to emotions,
which we measure using face-reading software. We find that sustainability levels impact
the emotional reactions of participants and that high sustainability leads to significantly
higher prices. While no significant effect of emotions was observed on purchase decisions,
a significant effect was identified for selling decisions. Moreover, social preferences and
the fraction of female traders increase overpricing given that the asset is sustainable.
